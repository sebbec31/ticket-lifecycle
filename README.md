<p>
In the Virtual Machine, paste the link below to take you to create the tickets.
  <ul>
    <li><a href="http://localhost/osTicket/">http://localhost/osTicket/</a></li>
</ul>
</p>

</p>
<p>
Use either Karen or Ken's information to generate the ticket. Choose a Help Topic that we created in the last tutorial and create a fake scenario that a customer might face in the realt world. In this example, Adobe Reader is not working and is affecting the entire Accounting Dept.

</p>
<p>
Now login and head back to the agent panel. You can use any of the agents created, or your own admin credentials to login.
</p>
<br />

</p>
<p>
Once you go in, click on the "Tickets" tab and you should see the ticket that was created. Go ahead and click on it.
</p>
<br />

</p>
<p>
Now assign the ticket to either a user(Agents) or the Admin(You) and set the SLA plan to an appropriate level for the problem(In this case I used SEV-A since it is directly affecting the business). Depending on the tickets you decide to create, try and understand what makes a SEV-A SLA and what makes a SEV-C SLA.

</p>
<p>
Once everything has been assigned, you can now respond to the customer and close the ticket to complete the ticket lifecycle.
